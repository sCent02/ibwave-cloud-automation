ðŸ“˜ Twincom Use Case â€“ iBwave Cloud Automation
ðŸŽ¯ Business Context

Twincom engineers use iBwave Unity to design and simulate in-building wireless systems.
These projects often involve complex 5G and PLTE simulations that require high-performance hardware.

Traditionally, simulations are run on:

Local laptops â†’ limited compute power, prone to slowdowns.

On-prem servers via RDP â†’ costly to maintain, inefficient, and insecure.

âš¡ Proposed Cloud-Based Workflow

This project shows how Twincom can move iBwave workloads to the cloud, using AWS automation.

RF Engineer uploads project (e.g., sample_project.ibw) to S3 bucket.

AWS Lambda automatically starts a GPU-enabled EC2 instance pre-configured with iBwave.

The License Server in the cloud authenticates usage.

Simulation runs â†’ results are saved back into S3.

Lambda stops the EC2 instance when simulation is complete (cost savings).

Engineer downloads results from S3 â€” no manual RDP required.

ðŸ“Š Business Value for Twincom

Cost Efficiency â†’ Pay only when simulations are running (on-demand cloud GPU).

Productivity Boost â†’ Engineers no longer waste time setting up RDP sessions.

Scalability â†’ Run multiple simulations in parallel across cloud instances.

Security â†’ IAM-based access replaces open RDP ports, reducing risks.

Future-Ready â†’ Same setup can extend to AI-based RF optimizations later.

ðŸ”„ Example Scenario

Engineer A uploads Mall_5G_Coverage.ibw to S3.

GitHub Actions pipeline triggers the workflow.

AWS Lambda starts a g4dn.xlarge EC2 instance â†’ simulation runs.

Once complete, results are pushed to S3.

Engineer A downloads the coverage heatmap and report.

EC2 instance automatically shuts down â†’ costs stop immediately.

ðŸš€ Why It Matters

This approach bridges DevOps automation with telecom engineering needs:

Engineers stay focused on RF design, not IT overhead.

Management gets clear cost control and scalability.

Twincom positions itself as cloud-first and innovation-driven.
